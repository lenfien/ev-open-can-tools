# Dashboard Guide

[Project Home](../) | [Documentation](index.md) | [Build & Flash](building.md) | [Plugin System](plugins.md) | [Release Notes](../CHANGELOG.md)

The dashboard is available on ESP32 builds that include `ESP32_DASHBOARD`. It runs from the device itself and is intended for local management at `http://192.168.4.1/` while connected to the device hotspot.

## Core Runtime Controls

- **Hardware**: switch the active runtime mode between `Legacy`, `HW3`, and `HW4`
- **Speed Profile**: follow the stalk automatically or lock a manual profile; HW4 adds `Max` and `Sloth`
- **Features**: only `Enable Logging` remains on the main card; the other vehicle overrides are no longer exposed there
- **Injection control**: stop or resume CAN injection without reflashing, then reboot from the UI when needed

## CAN Tools

- **CAN Sniffer**: live frame view with filtering by ID or known frame name
- **Wire / DBC ID toggle**: switch between on-wire 11-bit IDs and prefixed DBC-style IDs
- **CAN Recorder**: capture up to 2000 frames and export them as CSV
- **CAN Controller**: inspect per-mux RX/TX/error counters and controller error flags
- **Live Log**: view firmware log output directly in the dashboard

## Connectivity And Updates

- **WiFi Hotspot**: change AP name and password, optionally hide the SSID, and keep the values across reboots and firmware updates
- **WiFi Internet**: scan for networks, connect as STA, and optionally store a static IP/gateway/mask/DNS configuration
- **Firmware Update**: check GitHub releases, switch between stable and beta channel, enable auto-update on boot, or upload a local `.bin` manually
- **CAN Pins**: override TWAI TX/RX GPIO pins at runtime for supported boards; settings are stored in NVS
- **Settings Backup**: export and restore AP, WiFi, CAN pin, and update settings as JSON

## Plugins

- **Plugins card**: install from URL, upload a `.json`, or paste JSON directly when offline
- **Plugin list**: inspect rules, enable or disable plugins, remove them, and spot overlaps with built-in firmware handlers
- **Plugin Editor**: create plugins without hand-writing JSON, preview the result live, load an installed plugin back into the editor, and download the generated file
- **Rule Test**: generate a frame from one editor rule and send it repeatedly with a chosen count and interval before installing the plugin
- Plugin-based overrides such as nag suppression and Summon unlock can live here instead of on the main Features card
- Build-default behavior still applies for the compiled firmware features that are no longer exposed as dashboard toggles

## Persistence Notes

- WiFi hotspot settings, WiFi internet settings, update flags, CAN pins, and several runtime defaults are stored in NVS
- Installed plugins live on SPIFFS and their enabled or disabled state is restored on boot
- On AtomS3 Mini builds, the built-in button can toggle injection and that state is also persisted
